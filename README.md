Given air pollution dataset measured by high-cost sensors and low-cost sensors in Eindhoven, evaluate if we can improve the measurements by adding other observations, such as weather variables, to the regression model. 


Project description: 1) examine the relationship between air pollution concentration and several potential covariates. 2) Build multivariate linear models. Evaluate linearity by p-value and R squared-adjusted. 3) examine the correlation between variables. 4) evaluate the significance of each covariate. 5) build a linear model to fit scatter plot and evaluate the accuracy of fitting. 6) evaluate whether the regression model in Eindhoven is applicable in other countries.
